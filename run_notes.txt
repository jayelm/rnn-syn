ZERO-SHOT GENERALIZATION TO NEW OBJECT (TRIANGLE-RED)
1024 epochs, 20k components, 5/2/1: 0.35449 acc
1024 epochs, 20k components, 8/2/1: 0.33789 acc

1024 epochs, 20k components, 8/4/4 (keeping numbers constant): 0.202148
with 8/4/4, convergence is a lot more reliable, loss gets even smaller...

BTW: Could be that model only does well when red/triangle is the distractor, if
messages specifically encode object relations



GENERALIZATION TO NEW PAIR - square-blue-square-red, square-red-triangle-blue,
then generalize to square-blue-triangle-blue

This is boring, mainly serves to verify nature of messages

1024 epochs, 20k components, 5-2-1: 0.95606

GENERALIZATION TO DIRECTIONS - TODO
