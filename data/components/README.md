This contains raw image/attribute pairs. The filenames have the format

```
{n}-{targetShape}-{targetColor}-{distractorShape}-{distractorColor}-{x,y}-{t,d}.pkl.gz
```

where `n` is the (approximate) number of samples, `x` or `y` indicate the
relation, and `t` or `d` indicate targets or distractors.
